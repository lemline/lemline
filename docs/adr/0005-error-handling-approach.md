# [ADR-0005] Error Handling Approach

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The Lemline project implements a runtime for the Serverless Workflow DSL, which requires a robust error handling approach to manage failures during workflow execution, task processing, and system operations. We needed to decide on an error handling approach that would be comprehensive, consistent, and aligned with the project's requirements.

## Decision

We have decided to implement a multi-layered error handling approach with the following characteristics:

1. **Typed Exceptions**: We define a hierarchy of typed exceptions for different categories of errors, making it easier to handle specific error cases.

2. **Error Propagation**: We establish clear rules for when errors should be caught and handled locally versus when they should be propagated up the call stack.

3. **Retry Mechanisms**: We implement retry mechanisms with configurable policies (e.g., retry count, backoff strategy) for transient errors.

4. **Circuit Breakers**: We use circuit breakers for external service calls to prevent cascading failures.

5. **Compensation Logic**: We implement compensation logic to handle rollbacks and cleanup when errors occur during workflow execution.

6. **Error Logging**: We log errors with appropriate context information to facilitate debugging and monitoring.

7. **Error Reporting**: We provide clear error messages and status codes to clients, with appropriate levels of detail based on the environment (development vs. production).

8. **Global Error Handlers**: We implement global error handlers to catch and process unhandled exceptions.

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Robustness**: The comprehensive error handling approach makes the system more robust and resilient to failures.
- **Debuggability**: Detailed error logging and reporting make it easier to debug issues.
- **User Experience**: Clear error messages improve the user experience when errors occur.
- **Reliability**: Retry mechanisms and circuit breakers improve the reliability of the system, especially when interacting with external services.
- **Consistency**: A consistent approach to error handling makes the codebase more maintainable.

### Negative

- **Complexity**: The multi-layered approach adds complexity to the codebase.
- **Development Overhead**: Implementing comprehensive error handling requires additional development effort.
- **Performance Impact**: Some error handling mechanisms, such as retries and circuit breakers, can impact performance.
- **Learning Curve**: Developers need to understand the error handling approach to effectively work with the codebase.

## Alternatives Considered

### Simplified Error Handling

A simplified approach with fewer error handling mechanisms was considered. This approach was rejected because:
- It would make the system less robust and resilient to failures.
- It would make it harder to debug issues when they occur.
- It would provide a poorer user experience when errors occur.
- It would not align with the requirements for a production-grade workflow engine.

### Exception-based Control Flow

Using exceptions for control flow (e.g., using exceptions to handle normal business logic) was considered. This approach was rejected because:
- It would make the code harder to understand and maintain.
- It would lead to performance issues due to the overhead of exception handling.
- It would violate best practices for exception handling.
- It would make it harder to distinguish between actual errors and normal control flow.
