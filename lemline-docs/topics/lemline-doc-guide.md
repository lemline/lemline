# Documentation Guide

The Lemline documentation is structured following the [Di√°taxis framework](https://diataxis.fr/), which organizes
technical documentation into four distinct types based on how users approach and use documentation. This guide will help
you navigate to the right type of documentation for your needs.

## The Four Documentation Types

### üéì Tutorials

**Purpose**: Learning-oriented content focused on practical experience.

**When to use**:

- You're new to Lemline and want to learn by doing
- You want a guided, step-by-step journey to build confidence
- You prefer practical experience over conceptual understanding

### üß† Explanations
