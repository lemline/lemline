# Understanding the Serverless Workflow DSL

This document explains the Serverless Workflow Domain Specific Language (DSL), its design principles, and how Lemline implements it.

## What is Serverless Workflow DSL?

The Serverless Workflow DSL is a vendor-neutral, platform-independent workflow language created by the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)](https://www.cncf.io/). It provides a standard way to define workflow orchestration using a declarative approach. 

Key characteristics of the DSL include:

- **Declarative**: Focuses on what needs to be done, not how
- **JSON/YAML based**: Easy to read, write, and process
- **Portable**: Works across different cloud providers and platforms
- **Event-driven**: First-class support for events and messaging
- **Extensible**: Supports custom extensions for vendor-specific features

## Design Principles

### 1. Workflow as Code

The Serverless Workflow DSL treats workflows as code, enabling:

- **Version control**: Track changes with git or other VCS
- **CI/CD integration**: Automate testing and deployment
- **Review processes**: Code review workflows for changes
- **Reusability**: Define once, use in multiple contexts

### 2. Cloud Native

The DSL is designed to work seamlessly in cloud native environments:

- **Container-friendly**: Runs well in containerized environments
- **Kubernetes integration**: Designed for Kubernetes deployments
- **Scalability**: Supports horizontal scaling
- **Resilience**: Built-in error handling and compensation

### 3. Event-Driven Architecture

Event-driven principles are core to the design:

- **Event consumption**: Rich patterns for consuming events
- **Event correlation**: Match and correlate related events
- **Event production**: Emit events to trigger other processes
- **Event-based coordination**: Coordinate workflows via events

### 4. Function Composition

The DSL enables composition of serverless functions and microservices:

- **Service orchestration**: Coordinate multiple services
- **Function chaining**: Connect function outputs to inputs
- **Parallel execution**: Run functions concurrently
- **Conditional execution**: Apply business logic to function invocation

## Core Components

### Workflow Definition

The root structure contains metadata about the workflow:

```yaml
id: orderProcessing
version: '1.0.0'
specVersion: '0.8'
name: Order Processing Workflow
description: Processes customer orders
```

### States

States define steps in the workflow execution:

```yaml
states:
  - name: Validate Order
    type: operation
    actions:
      - functionRef:
          refName: validateOrder
    transition: Process Payment
```

### Events

Event definitions describe events consumed or produced:

```yaml
events:
  - name: PaymentProcessed
    type: payment.processed
    source: paymentService
```

### Functions

Function definitions describe service invocations:

```yaml
functions:
  - name: validateOrder
    operation: http://validationservice/validate
```

### Transitions

Transitions define the flow between states:

```yaml
transition: Process Payment  # Direct transition
transition:
  nextState: Process Payment  # Conditional transition
  condition: ${ .order.total > 0 }
```

## Lemline Implementation

Lemline implements the Serverless Workflow DSL version 1.0.0 with:

### YAML-First Approach

While the specification supports both JSON and YAML, Lemline uses YAML as the primary format for enhanced readability:

```yaml
# Lemline workflow definition example
version: "1.0.0"
name: orderProcessing
do:
  - validateOrder:
      callHTTP:
        url: "http://validate-service/orders/validate"
        method: "POST"
        body: "${ .order }"
  - processPayment:
      callHTTP:
        url: "http://payment-service/payments"
        method: "POST"
        body:
          orderId: "${ .order.id }"
          amount: "${ .order.total }"
```

### Enhanced Expression Support

Lemline enhances the expression capabilities with JQ support:

```yaml
set:
  totalWithTax: "${ .order.total * (1 + .taxRate) }"
  discountedItems: "${ .order.items[] | select(.discount > 0) }"
  itemCount: "${ .order.items | length }"
```

### Node-Based Execution Model

Internally, Lemline translates the DSL into a node graph:

```
┌───────────┐     ┌───────────┐     ┌───────────┐
│ Validate  │     │ Process   │     │ Ship      │
│ Order     │ ──> │ Payment   │ ──> │ Order     │
└───────────┘     └───────────┘     └───────────┘
```

Each node represents a task in the workflow, with its own:
- Input/output data
- Execution state
- Error handling capabilities
- Position tracking for resumability

### Extension Mechanism

Lemline supports extensions to the standard DSL:

```yaml
extension:
  monitoring:
    level: "detailed"
    metrics:
      - name: "processing_time"
        unit: "milliseconds"
```

## DSL Structure in Lemline

Lemline organizes workflow definitions into these main sections:

### Metadata

Basic workflow information:

```yaml
version: "1.0.0"
namespace: "com.example"
name: "orderProcessing"
description: "Process customer orders"
```

### Resources

Shared resources used throughout the workflow:

```yaml
use:
  authentications:
    - name: "serviceAuth"
      oauth2:
        # OAuth2 configuration
  errors:
    - name: "paymentFailed"
      # Error definition
  retries:
    - name: "standardRetry"
      # Retry policy
```

### Input/Output Schema

Data schemas for workflow inputs and outputs:

```yaml
input:
  schema:
    type: "object"
    properties:
      orderId:
        type: "string"
      items:
        type: "array"

output:
  schema:
    type: "object"
    properties:
      orderStatus:
        type: "string"
```

### Workflow Tasks

The actual steps to execute:

```yaml
do:
  - validateOrder:
      # Task definition
  - processPayment:
      # Task definition
```

## Best Practices

### Workflow Design Principles

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each workflow should have a clear, focused purpose
2. **Idempotency**: Design workflows to be safely retryable
3. **Data Minimalism**: Pass only necessary data between tasks
4. **Explicit Error Handling**: Define how errors should be managed
5. **Event Correlation**: Use correlation identifiers for event matching

### Organizing Complex Workflows

1. **Sub-workflows**: Break large workflows into manageable sub-workflows
2. **Domain Separation**: Group related tasks by domain or function
3. **State Machines**: Use state-based design for complex processes
4. **Event Choreography**: Consider choreography for loosely coupled systems

### Performance Considerations

1. **Parallel Execution**: Use `fork` for concurrent tasks
2. **Data Transformation**: Minimize unnecessary data transformations
3. **Service Integration**: Use appropriate integration patterns (sync/async)
4. **Checkpoint Frequency**: Balance persistence and performance

## DSL Evolution

- **Version 0.8**: Initial public release
- **Version 0.9**: Enhanced event correlation and function definition
